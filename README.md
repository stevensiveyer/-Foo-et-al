#  Foo et al
 The fictional Foo et al parameterization for calculating the volume of a sphere 

there are four python files part of this software package
1. foo-et-al.py
2. changeRadius.py
3. calculatePi.py
4. main.py

foo-et-al.py is where the initialization of all the variables necessary for the volume of the sphere are created and the calculation using the Foo et al parameterization occurs to calculte the volume of the sphere

changeRadius.py has a function that given the radius of the sphere makes the necessary changes that are defined by the Foo et al. parameterization (converting) and returns that value

calculatePi.py has a function where calculations to find pi are done and returned

main.py allows for a simple
